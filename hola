1.Data Preprocessing

a. First at all we need to import all of those libreraries we need in order to deploy a proper project:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib as plt
import scipy.stats

b. Import the data(for instance a csv document):

df= pd.read_csv('hello.csv')

c. To get rid of variables, which lacks of some values:

There are two options when it comes to fulfill this requirement, to delete info or to replace it. 

#

Before we proceed to manage the following steps, we need to make sure that we won't overlook some data that being different to np.nan mimic it:
df.replace(x,np.nan,inplace= True)
  being x = '-',0, among others.
#

In order to make up one mind regarding which option to choose, we need firstly to count the number of values that we missed:

for column in df.columns.values.tolist():
    print(column)
    print(df[column].isnull().value_counts())
    print('')

...The result of this code will be a list with the name of the different columns followed by the a summary of its values in the following fashion:


*Import picture*

Otherwise we could directly delete all those columns which missed values outweighted the non-missed values.

drop= []
for column in df.columns.values.tolist():
    if df[column].isnull().value_counts().idxmax() == True:
        print(column)
        drop.append(str(column))
        df.drop(drop,axis=1,inplace=True)
        
...The result of this code will be a our data with those columns
